General Advice
--------------

If you are planning on building a feature please raise a github issue describing the requirement to ensure someone else
is not already building the same capability.

When you raise the github issue please explain how you are going to architect the capability.  There are some pointers
here on design principals but it would be good to get some visibility on what you are planning sooner rather than later.


Building locally
----------------

You can build and run this framework locally.  There is a Makefile to make this easier for you.  In order to run the
Make targets you will need to have python poetry and python 3.7 installed.  We recommend using pipx to install poetry.

Running ``make help`` will display a description of the targets along with a description of what they do.
